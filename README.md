== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. **Why am I seeing new signups in ContactUs.com that aren't getting posted to MailChimp?**
Just as a reminder, if you are using MailChimp or several other email providers, they may force double opt-in.  This means that a new subscriber not only needs to sign up with your form, but then also receive a follow-up email message from the email provider confirming the interest.  If you see a lead in your ContactUs.com account but not in your MailChimp account, this may be the reason.

2. **How does this Plugin help my website?**
ContactUs.com MailChimp plugin allows you to obtain newsletter subscribers in an easier and more efficient way. With our multiple templates, our plugin allows you to approach potential newsletter subscribers in a non-intrusive way. Our templates designs have been worked carefully, so people can easily find them and think of them as an opportunity to stay in touch with you.

3. **What kind of implementation do you offer?** 
Similar to our contact form, our ContactUs.com MailChimp Plugin, offers to implement it as a proactive tab or embedded on a page you choose. It also allows you to customize the implementation, so you can decide what to have, on each page of your WordPress website.  

4. **How many subscribers can I get through this plugin?**
How many newsletter subscribers you sign-up will depend on how many visitors you have to your website. Our goal with this plugin is to generate more sign-ups in proportion to your overall web traffic.  The plugin achieves this by offering more proactive form placements and using better-designed form templates.

5. **Can I use both ContactUs.com Contact Form Plugin and ContactUs.com MailChimp Plugin at the same time?**
Currently it's only possible to use one plugin at the time. We are working so it can be possible to use both plugins on your site at the same time. We will notify you when that goes live.

6. **Where do I get my API Key?** 
To generate your API Key, you need to log in to your Mailchimp.com account. Once you are logged in, follow these steps: Click on your user name > Account Settings > Extras > API Keys. In this section you will be able to create a key that will allow you to connect your account with ContactUs.com MailChimp plugin.  Follow this link from MailChimp for more information: http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key

7. **I have been getting the following message on the plugin: "ERROR: {"error":"MMERGE3 must be provided - Please enter a value","code":250}" what does that mean, and how can I fix it?**
PLEASE CHECK IF YOU HAVE ANY CUSTOM FIELDS IN YOUR LIST that are marked as "Required". 
If you have the default MailChimp settings, then you won't have to change anything.  However, if you have added any custom fields to your list, you need to uncheck any "required" fields you have on your account.  Otherwise, they will not post to MailChimp from your ContactUs.com form.
To complete this you need to login to your account (www.mailchimp.com), go to "Lists" on the top. Go to "Settings" => "List Fields and Merge Tags". Uncheck any custom fields you have created (i.e., anything besides Email, First Name and Last Name). Click "Save" and then it's good.
